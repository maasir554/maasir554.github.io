            <h1>Why Sanskriti Hotels?</h1>
            <p>
              Our Uniqueness is the answer to this question. We are different
              from other hotel chains because of the Indian traditional touch in
              our work culture. Whether you are in any of our branch accross the
              globe, Indian serving is offered as an option alternatevie to
              modern hotel service.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our buildings' achetecture somewhat resembles the traditional
              Indian Forts, and Mehals. Customers say that they feel to have
              entered a completely different world, where everything feels
              Royal.
            </p>

            <p>
              2% of our profit goes to The Sanskriti Welfare Organization, which
              is an NGO under The Sanskriti Hotels Foundation. This NGO have

              got admissions, in reputed Schools without paying the fees,
              because of this NGO.

            <h1>How we started ?</h1>
            <p>
              We started since India got it's independence. Sanskriti Hotels was
              started from a guest house in Mumbai. A multicultural team founded
              this hotel chain. In 1947, the first branch was established named
              as Sanskriti Guest House, which is present day Indian Royal
              Palace, Mumbai. it had 15 people working in the staff. The
              building had a small area of 5000 sq. ft. and only two floors.
              which slowly expanded, by purchasing nesarby buildinngs, and at
              present it is having an area of 30,000 sq. ft with six floors .
              The goal was simple. we had to provide luxury to custumers, and
              this is what we did from the very begining.
